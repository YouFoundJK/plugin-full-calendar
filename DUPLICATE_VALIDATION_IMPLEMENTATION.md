# Duplicate Event Validation Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds real-time duplicate event validation to prevent users from creating events with the same name on the same day, improving the user experience by showing errors during input rather than after submission.

## Key Changes

### 1. Abstract Base Class (`EditableCalendar.ts`)
Added abstract method for duplicate checking:
```typescript
abstract checkForDuplicate(event: OFCEvent): Promise<boolean>;
```

### 2. Calendar Implementations

#### FullNoteCalendar
- Checks if a file with the computed filename already exists
- Uses the same path generation logic as `createEvent`

#### DailyNoteCalendar
- Checks if an event with the same title exists in the daily note for that date
- Reads existing events from the daily note file

#### GoogleCalendar
- Returns `false` since Google Calendar allows duplicate events by design
- Prevents unnecessary API calls for validation

### 3. EventCache Integration
Added public method to expose validation to UI:
```typescript
async checkForDuplicate(calendarId: string, event: OFCEvent): Promise<boolean>
```

### 4. UI Component Changes (`EditEvent.tsx`)

#### New State Variables
- `validationError`: Stores current validation error message
- `isValidating`: Shows loading state during validation

#### Real-time Validation
- Debounced validation with 500ms delay
- Triggered on title, date, or calendar changes
- Uses `useCallback` and `useEffect` for optimal performance

#### User Interface
- Inline error messages below title field
- Loading indicator during validation
- Submit button disabled when errors exist
- Clear, actionable error messages

### 5. Modal Integration (`event_modal.ts`)
Updated both create and edit modals to pass validation function:
- Create modal: Direct validation against target calendar
- Edit modal: Excludes current event from duplicate check

## User Experience Flow

### Before (Problem)
1. User fills out event form
2. User clicks "Save Event"
3. Modal closes
4. Backend validation fails
5. Error notice appears
6. User must reopen modal and re-enter all data

### After (Solution)
1. User starts typing event title
2. Real-time validation runs after 500ms
3. Error appears immediately if duplicate detected
4. Submit button becomes disabled
5. User can fix the issue without losing form data
6. Form only submits when validation passes

## Error Messages
- **Duplicate detected**: "An event with this name already exists on this date. Please choose a different name."
- **During validation**: "Checking for duplicates..."

## Performance Considerations
- 500ms debouncing prevents excessive validation calls
- Validation only runs for editable calendars
- Google Calendar skips validation to avoid API overhead
- Failed validations don't block submission (graceful degradation)

## Backward Compatibility
- Original duplicate checking remains as fallback
- Existing error handling unchanged
- No breaking changes to API or data structures
- All existing tests continue to pass

## Testing
- ✅ Compilation: No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Unit tests: All 92 tests pass
- ✅ Linting: Code follows style guidelines
- ✅ Build: Production build succeeds

## Files Modified
1. `src/calendars/EditableCalendar.ts` - Added abstract method
2. `src/calendars/FullNoteCalendar.ts` - Implemented file-based validation
3. `src/calendars/DailyNoteCalendar.ts` - Implemented daily note validation
4. `src/calendars/GoogleCalendar.ts` - Added no-op implementation
5. `src/core/EventCache.ts` - Added public validation method
6. `src/core/EventCache.test.ts` - Added mock for tests
7. `src/ui/modals/components/EditEvent.tsx` - Added real-time validation UI
8. `src/ui/event_modal.ts` - Integrated validation in modals

This implementation successfully addresses the original issue by moving validation from post-submission to real-time input validation, significantly improving the user experience while maintaining all existing functionality.
