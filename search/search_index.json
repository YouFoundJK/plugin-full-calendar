The latest version 0.12.2 introduces event reminders with desktop notifications, multi-account Google Calendar support, and lightning-fast performance improvements with lazy loading and event-driven architecture.</p> <p>Previous releases brought powerful Advanced Categories system for coloring and organization, a reimagined recurring event engine, Calendar Workspaces for quick setup switching, and the Chrono Analyser dashboard for time-based insights.</p> <p>This documentation site will guide you through setup and advanced features.

A new \"Tasks\" calendar source syncs your tasks directly onto the calendar. Features include a dedicated task backlog, drag-and-drop rescheduling, and in-calendar completion. Create, update, and delete tasks without leaving the calendar view.</p> </li> <li> <p>New: Advanced Date Navigation (#106)     Navigate your calendar with precision using the new \"Go To\" dropdown in the toolbar. It features a reusable <code>DatePicker</code> and context-aware navigation. Right-click on the calendar to jump to a specific month, week, or day.</p> </li> <li> <p>Improvement: Task Management Workflow &amp; Parsing (#132, #134, #138)     The Tasks integration includes advanced parsing for dated and undated tasks, multi-day event support, and custom status detection. A new setting allows stripping tags from task titles for a cleaner display. The entire parsing logic is covered by a comprehensive test suite for maximum reliability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Improvement: Performance &amp; Stability     The plugin now performs surgical updates on file changes instead of full-vault rescans, significantly improving performance in large vaults. Remote calendars now load in a non-blocking, priority-ordered manner, and race conditions during event source removal have been fixed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Improvement: Provider Architecture     The provider registry now loads calendars with priority and uses a new <code>isFileRelevant()</code> hook for cleaner file-change handling. \"Manage calendar\" logic has been delegated to the respective providers for better modularity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fix: Notification and Reminder Reliability     End-time reminders now fire correctly for events that are already in progress, ensuring you never miss the end of an important block of time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fix: Core Component Stability (#100, #101, #126)     Fixed numerous bugs, including a race condition when removing event sources, an issue preventing the create modal from appearing if no editable calendars exist, and a bug where the Daily Notes calendar would fail without a template.

The analyser will then automatically switch to the more powerful Category-Based mode.</p> <p>Q: My insights look wrong or are empty. What should I do? A: The quality of your insights depends entirely on your configuration. Click the <code>\u2699\ufe0f</code> icon in the Insights panel and carefully review your Insight Groups. Ensure that the hierarchies, projects, and keywords you've entered exactly match the data in your events.</p> <p>Q: How does the \"Habit Consistency\" insight work? A: It looks for activities that you performed consistently in the past but have missed recently. By default, it flags any project that was logged 2 or more times in the last 30 days but has not been logged at all in the last 7 days.</p> <p>Q: Will generating insights slow down Obsidian? A: No. The core charting dashboard is designed to be fast and lightweight.
