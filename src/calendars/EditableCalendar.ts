 * This file contains the `EditableCalendar` abstract class, which extends
 * `Calendar`. It establishes the contract for calendars whose event data is
 * stored within the Obsidian Vault and can be created, updated, and deleted
 * by the user. This class separates read-write local calendars from
 * read-only remote calendars.
