/**
 * @file ViewEnhancer.ts
 * @brief Orchestrates presentation-layer logic for the calendar view.
 *
 * @description
 * This class acts as the single intermediary between the EventCache and the
 * CalendarView. It composes one or more "enhancement modules" (like the
 * WorkspaceManager) to apply all necessary data transformations and configuration
 * overrides before the data is rendered.
 *
 * This decouples complex business logic from the view, making the view a "dumb"
 * renderer and centralizing the transformation logic for consistency and testability.
