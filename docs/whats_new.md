## üé® Powerful Advanced Categories & Coloring

Supercharge your calendar's organization with Advanced Categories! This new system allows you to override a calendar's default color for specific events based on a category prefix in the event's title. It's the foundation for many powerful features to come.

-   **Universal Organization:** Works for local and remote calendars. An event from Google Calendar titled `Work - Project Deadline` will be colored correctly in Obsidian.
-   **Sub-Categories:** Organize even further with a `Category - SubCategory - Title` format.
-   **Smart Setup:** When you enable the feature, the plugin can automatically categorize your existing events based on their folder structure.
-   **Autocomplete Editor:** The event editor now has a dedicated "Category" field with autocomplete suggestions for all your existing categories, ensuring consistency.

## ‚ú® Recurring Events Reimagined

The entire recurring event system has been rebuilt from the ground up to be more powerful, intuitive, and safe.

- **Per-Instance Editing:** Drag, resize, or rename a single occurrence of a recurring event without affecting the entire series. The plugin automatically creates a smart "override" that is linked to the parent.
- **Recurring Tasks That Work:** Check off a single instance of a recurring task as "done." It will be crossed out for that day only, leaving future occurrences ready for action.
- **Safe Deletion:** When deleting a recurring event, you'll now be asked whether you want to delete just that one instance, or the entire series (including any overrides you've made).

## üåç Robust Timezone Support

Travel and collaborate across timezones with confidence. Full Calendar is now fully timezone-aware, ensuring your events always appear at the correct local time, no matter where you are.

-   **Display Timezone:** Set a specific timezone for your calendar view, independent of your system's timezone. Perfect for planning trips or coordinating with remote teams.
-   **Automatic Conversion:** Events from all sources‚Äîlocal notes, daily notes, and remote calendars like Google Calendar‚Äîare automatically converted to your chosen display timezone.
