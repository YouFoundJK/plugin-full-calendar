## ‚ú® Recurring Events Reimagined

The entire recurring event system has been rebuilt from the ground up to be more powerful, intuitive, and safe.

- **Per-Instance Editing:** Drag, resize, or rename a single occurrence of a recurring event without affecting the entire series. The plugin automatically creates a smart "override" that is linked to the parent.
- **Recurring Tasks That Work:** Check off a single instance of a recurring task as "done." It will be crossed out for that day only, leaving future occurrences ready for action.
- **Safe Deletion:** When deleting a recurring event, you'll now be asked whether you want to delete just that one instance, or the entire series (including any overrides you've made).
