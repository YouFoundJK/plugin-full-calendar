# Full Calendar Remastered Plugin

Keep your calendar in your vault! This plugin integrates the [FullCalendar.io](https://fullcalendar.io/) library into your Obsidian Vault. Keep your schedule, events, and plans alongside your tasks and notes, and link freely between them.

With Full Calendar, you can connect to [local note-based calendars](calendars/local.md), your [daily notes](calendars/dailynote.md), remote sources like [Google Calendar](calendars/gcal.md) with two-way sync, [CalDAV providers](calendars/caldav.md) (iCloud, Fastmail), local or remote [`.ics` files](calendars/ics.md), and even your [Obsidian Tasks](calendars/tasks-plugin-integration.md).

The latest version 0.12.7 introduces **[Local ICS Support](calendars/ics.md)**, a dramatically improved **Staged Loading Architecture** for lightning-fast startup, and completely rewritten **[Timezone & DST Hardening](events/timezones.md)** to ensure accurate events everywhere.

Recent major releases have brought incredible features like **[Full CalDAV Two-Way Sync](calendars/caldav.md)**, **[Mobile Workspaces & Monthly Views](views/workspaces.md)**, **[Multi-Language (i18n) Support](features/i18n.md)**, a deeply integrated **[Tasks Provider](calendars/tasks-plugin-integration.md)** with drag-and-drop backlog, and powerful additions like the **[Chrono Analyser dashboard](chrono_analyser/introduction.md)** and **[Advanced Categories system](events/categories.md)**.


This documentation site will guide you through setup and advanced features. If something is unclear, don't hesitate to [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/YouFoundJK/plugin-full-calendar/issues).
