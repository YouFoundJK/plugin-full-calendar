# Full Calendar

Keep your calendar in your vault! This plugin integrates the [FullCalendar.io](https://fullcalendar.io/) library into your Obsidian Vault. Keep your schedule, events, and plans alongside your tasks and notes, and link freely between them.

With Full Calendar, you can connect to local note-based calendars, your daily notes, and even remote sources like Google Calendar, iCloud, and Fastmail.

This documentation site will guide you through setup and advanced features. If something is unclear, don't hesitate to [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/YouFoundJK/plugin-full-calendar/issues).
