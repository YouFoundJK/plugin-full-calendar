### Two Powerful Modes of Analysis

The Chrono Analyser adapts to your workflow. It operates in one of two modes, depending on your main Full Calendar plugin settings.

!!! success "Mode 1: Category-Based Analysis (Recommended)"
    -   **Requirement:** The **"Category Coloring"** feature is **enabled** in the main plugin settings.
    -   **How it Works:** The analyser uses the `Category` of your events as the top-level grouping (`Hierarchy`). This is the most powerful mode.
    -   **Supported Calendars:** ‚úÖ **All of them!** Full Note, Daily Note, Google Calendar, CalDAV, and ICS calendars are all included in the analysis, giving you a complete picture of your time.

!!! info "Mode 2: Folder-Based Analysis (Legacy)"
    -   **Requirement:** The **"Category Coloring"** feature is **disabled**.
    -   **How it Works:** The analyser uses the **folder path** of your `FullNoteCalendar` sources as the `Hierarchy`.
    -   **Supported Calendars:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Only events from **Full Note Calendars** are processed in this mode.

## Features

The Chrono Analyser is composed of two main features: the Proactive Insights Engine and the Interactive Charting Dashboard.

### ‚ú® The Proactive Insights Engine

This is the intelligent core of the analyser. Instead of forcing you to hunt for patterns, the engine analyzes your entire history and presents key findings automatically.

**How it Works:**

1.  **Configure (`‚öôÔ∏è` icon):** The first step is to teach the engine about your life. Click the `‚öôÔ∏è` icon to open the configuration wizard.
2.  **Create Insight Groups:** Define your own custom groups, like "Client Work," "Study," "Fitness," or "Family Time." For each group, you create simple rules based on your existing hierarchies (categories or folders), projects, and keywords.
3.  **Generate Insights:** Click the **"Generate Insights"** button. The engine will perform a non-blocking analysis of your data in the background.
4.  **Get Actionable Results:** The panel will populate with easy-to-read cards, highlighting trends, inconsistencies, and important summaries.
5.  **Explore Further:** Many insight cards are interactive. **Click on an insight** to instantly configure the main chart below to show you the relevant data for a deeper dive.

### üìä The Interactive Charting Dashboard

This is your powerful, hands-on tool for exploring your data visually.

-   **Global Filters:** Filter all charts by Hierarchy (Category/Folder) and Project using intuitive autocomplete inputs.
-   **Date Range Selector:** Use the interactive date picker or preset buttons (Today, This Week, etc.) to narrow your analysis to a specific period.
-   **Analysis Types:**
    -   **Category Breakdown (Pie/Sunburst):** See how your time is distributed. Click any segment to open a detailed popup with every contributing event.
    -   **Time-Series Trend:** Visualize your effort over time. See an overall trend line or a stacked area chart to compare categories.
    -   **Activity Patterns:** Discover your peak productivity windows with heatmaps and charts for the day of the week and hour of the day.

**The Student:**

-   Use the Activity Patterns heatmap to find your best study times.

**The Habit Builder:**
-   Create an Insight Group for "Wellness" with projects like "Gym," "Meditation," and "Reading."
-   The "Habit Consistency" table will instantly show you which habits you've missed, helping you get back on track.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Why aren't my Google Calendar / remote events showing up in the analysis?**
A: This happens when you are in Folder-Based (Legacy) Mode. To include all calendar sources, go to the main **Full Calendar plugin settings** and **enable the** ["Category Coloring" feature](events/categories.md). The analyser will then automatically switch to the more powerful Category-Based mode.

**Q: My insights look wrong or are empty. What should I do?**
A: The quality of your insights depends entirely on your configuration. Click the `‚öôÔ∏è` icon in the Insights panel and carefully review your **Insight Groups**. Ensure that the hierarchies, projects, and keywords you've entered exactly match the data in your events.

**Q: How does the "Habit Consistency" insight work?**
A: It looks for activities that you performed consistently in the past but have missed recently. By default, it flags any project that was logged 2 or more times in the last 30 days but has not been logged at all in the last 7 days.

**Q: Will generating insights slow down Obsidian?**
A: No. The core charting dashboard is designed to be fast and lightweight. The Insight Engine only runs when you explicitly click the **"Generate Insights"** button, and it performs its analysis in non-blocking chunks so the Obsidian interface remains responsive.
