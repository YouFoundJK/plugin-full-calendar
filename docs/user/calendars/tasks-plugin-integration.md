# Tasks Plugin Integration

!!! abstract "Philosophy"
    The Tasks integration is a **bidirectional time-blocking bridge**. It transforms your [Obsidian Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) into interactive calendar blocks, allowing you to drag unscheduled items from a sidebar backlog directly into your daily schedule.


!!! tip "Power Up with Categories"
    Tasks also support **[Advanced Categories](../events/categories.md)**. Add a category prefix to your task (e.g., `- [ ] Work - Finish report`) to color-code it on your calendar grid.

## Core Workflow

The integration revolves around two surfaces: the **Backlog** (where unscheduled tasks live) and the **Calendar** (where scheduled tasks are blocked).

1.  **Collect**: Write tasks in any markdown file using the Tasks plugin syntax.
2.  **Queue**: Open the **Tasks Backlog** sidebar (via the **[Command Palette](../guides/commands-and-shortcuts.md)**) to see undated items.
3.  **Schedule**: Drag a task from the backlog onto a calendar time slot. Full Calendar surgically updates the markdown file with the appropriate date emoji and time block.

4.  **Execute**: Mark tasks as complete directly on the calendar; the checkbox state syncs back to your note instantly.

## Backlog Filtering

The Tasks Backlog supports two filters that work together:

- **Missing Date** dropdown: selects which missing Tasks date marker defines backlog membership (`⏳`, `🛫`, or `📅`).
- **Fuzzy Search** input: filters visible backlog rows by task title, file name, or full file path.

### Fuzzy Search behavior

- Search is case-insensitive.
- Multiple keywords are supported (space-separated).
- A keyword matches if it appears directly or as a fuzzy character subsequence in title/path text.

Examples:

- `meeting daily` matches tasks with both terms across title/path.
- `projA/roadmap` matches by path fragment.
- `wkpln` can match `weekly-plan` via fuzzy subsequence matching.

## Data Mapping & Emojis

Full Calendar respects the Tasks plugin's emoji-based data model. You can configure which specific date field controls the calendar display.

| Setting | Emoji | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| **Scheduled Date** | `⏳` | **Default.** Best for daily "to-do" scheduling. |
| **Start Date** | `🛫` | Best for tracking when you *begin* a multi-day effort. |
| **Due Date** | `📅` | Best for hard deadlines and commitments. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No Fallback**: If you set the calendar to show "Due Dates," a task with *only* a scheduled date (`⏳`) will stay in the backlog and will not appear on the calendar until a due date (`📅`) is added.

## Time-Blocking Syntax

To position a task at a specific time (rather than just as an "all-day" event), Full Calendar supports two formats.

**Default write format (new behavior): Day Planner**

| Format | Example | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Day Planner Range** | `- [ ] 5:00 - 19:00 Wellness - Task` | Preferred default for new/updated tasks |
| **Day Planner Point Time** | `- [ ] 14:30 Standup` | Timed task with default duration |

**Legacy format (still supported for reading/parsing):**

| Syntax | Example | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Point Time** | `(14:30)` | Starts at 2:30 PM (default duration) |
| **Time Range** | `(9:00-10:30)` | Blocks exactly 90 minutes |
| **12h Format** | `(2:30 PM)` | Correctly parsed and displayed |

### Format Schema

Day Planner schema:

```text
- [ ] <H:mm> - <H:mm> <title text> <date marker>
- [ ] <H:mm> <title text> <date marker>
```

Legacy schema:

```text
- [ ] <title text> (<H:mm-H:mm>) <date marker>
- [ ] <title text> (<H:mm>) <date marker>
```

Where `<date marker>` is one of `⏳ YYYY-MM-DD`, `🛫 YYYY-MM-DD`, or `📅 YYYY-MM-DD` (depending on integration settings).

**Example Task Lines:**

- `- [ ] 5:00 - 19:00 Sync with Team ⏳ 2025-03-28`
- `- [ ] Sync with Team (14:00-15:00) ⏳ 2025-03-28`

*Dragging an event on the calendar automatically updates this time-block in your markdown.*

> [!NOTE]
> Full Calendar parses both formats automatically in calendar/backlog views. You do not need to migrate older tasks for them to remain visible and schedulable.

## Power User Features

The integration includes several automatic behaviors to keep your calendar clean:

*   **Title Cleaning**: If enabled in settings, Full Calendar can automatically strip `#tags` from task titles on the calendar view for a cleaner look.
*   **Default Durations**: Timed tasks without an end-time (e.g., `(14:30)`) are assigned a default **30-minute duration**.
*   **Multi-Day & Custom Statuses**: Tasks spanning multiple days or using custom statuses (e.g., `/`, `>`, `-`) are correctly parsed and rendered.

## Integration Settings

Once you add a **Tasks** source in **[Calendar Settings](../settings/sources.md)**, a new **Integrations → Tasks** section appears:

*   **Backlog Filter Date**: Choose which missing date makes a task "unscheduled" (e.g., show tasks missing a `⏳`).
*   **Calendar Display Date**: Choose which date determines the task's position on the grid.
*   **Auto-Open Edit Modal**: If enabled, dropping a task from the backlog will immediately open the Tasks plugin's native edit modal for further refinement.
*   **Task Time Format**: Choose how Full Calendar writes time back to task lines. Default is **Day Planner Format**.
